# Levenber-Marquardt adjustment algorithm

### The repository

It includes two versions of a pyhton implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) for fitting a given function to a set of points.

### Example

It contains an example of a fit, with experimental data obtained from a damped oscillation experiment.
The "functions.py" file contains implemented functions that describes standard, damped and driven-damped oscillations.
The "Fitting_ex.py" uses the LM algorithm to fit the example curve.
The following image shows the result. The data was obtained experimentally from a brass mass held by a spring and droped in a container of water.
